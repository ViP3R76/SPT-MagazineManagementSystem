# Magazine Management System

A server-sided mod for Single Player Tarkov (SPT) 3.11.

## Features
- "Should" work on FIKA Installations
- Adjust magazine load-/unload speeds individually or globally.
- Optionally disable ammo load/unload penalties.
- Resize 3x1 magazines to 2x1 for better inventory management.
- Config validation with defaults applied automatically.
- Minimal console output; detailed logs with `debug: true`.

## Installation (Server)
1. Ensure SPT 3.11 is installed.
2. Copy the `MagazineManagementSystem` folder to `user/mods/`.
3. Start your SPT server.

## Configuration
Be sure to load this mod AFTER other mods that maybe change the same settings. (e.g. change load order)
Edit `config/config.jsonc` in the mod folder. A default config is created on first run if absent.

### Config Options
```jsonc
{
  "ammo.loadspeed": 0.5,          // Load speed multiplier (0 to 1); unused if useGlobalTimes is true
  "ammo.unloadspeed": 0.5,        // Unload speed multiplier (0 to 1); applied via CheckOverride
  "min.MagazineSize": 10,         // Minimum magazine capacity to adjust (2 to 60, or -1 for no min)
  "max.MagazineSize": 60,         // Maximum magazine capacity to adjust (10 to 100, or -1 for no max)
  "useGlobalTimes": false,        // True: use baseLoadTime/baseUnloadTime globally; False: per-magazine speeds
  "baseLoadTime": 0.85,           // Global load time (0.01 to 1, 2 decimals); used if useGlobalTimes is true
  "baseUnloadTime": 0.3,          // Global unload time (0.01 to 1, 2 decimals); used if useGlobalTimes is true
  "DisableMagazineAmmoLoadPenalty": false, // True: sets LoadUnloadModifier to 0; False: ensures itâ€™s 1
  "Resize3to2SlotMagazine": false, // True: resizes 3x1 magazines to 2x1
  "debug": false                  // True: enables detailed logging
}
```
## Requirements (Client) - only if Resize3to2SlotMagazine is used (!)
1. Start your SPT Launcher
2. Open Settings
3. Clean temp files
